# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Motor Speed Control via Hand Gesture and Python-Arduino Serial Communication  This project demonstrates how to control a DC motor using hand gestures detected by Python (OpenCV &amp; MediaPipe) and serial communication with an Arduino. Gestures are used to adjust motor speed, direction, or stop the motor entirely.
